<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[//]: # ([![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]&#40;https://example.com&#41;)

This is just a hobby project with me trying to simulate how a Market Making entity within a financial market environment
might perform using order flow and taking advantage of the bid-ask spread on certain assets. The inspiration for this
project came when I was watching 'Eat the Rich: The GameStop Saga' on Netflix. One of the episodes explains Citadel's
involvement in the drama, where it acted as a market maker for Robinhood trading GME.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### To run this Python project, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have Python installed: Before running the project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You
   can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
   follow the installation instructions.

2. Set up the environment: It is recommended to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and isolate
   them from other Python projects. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and create a new virtual
   environment: `python -m venv venv`

3. Activate the virtual environment:
    * On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    * On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install project dependencies: With the virtual environment activated, install the required project dependencies using
   pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Make sure you have the requirements.txt file containing the list of required
   packages and their versions for the
   project.
5. Run the main script: Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, you can execute the main script
   of
   the project by running: `python main.py`.
   The main.py file is the entry point of the project, and running this command will start the project's execution.
6. Observe the output: Depending on the project's current state, this could be quite interesting or obscenely boring.

To deactivate the virtual environment: When you are finished with the project, you can deactivate the virtual
environment
by running: `deactivate`

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_ which is currently a work in progress, if
at all existent.
